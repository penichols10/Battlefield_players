    "# Approach: Use Selenium to Load JSON\n",
    "First, a quick discussion of the [website](https://battlefieldtracker.com/bfv/leaderboards/stats/all/Wins?type=stats&page=1) layout. The previous link is to the first leaderboard page sorted by the number of games users have won. This does not in and of itself provide us with much information. But you can click on each user on the leaderboard and see an associated profile. This profile contains a lot of useful information. We would like to collect this information for every user on every page of the leaderboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data on the website is loaded using Javascript. This means that simply sending GET requests and parsing HTML using Python's request library will not work - the HTML will not contain the desired data as it will not have been loaded. A plausible approach is to just use Selenium to load the leaderboard pages, get the HTML once data has been loaded onto the page with Javascript, find profile URLs from the leaderboard page HTML, load the profile pages with Selenium, then go through the profile page HTML to find data. There are two problems with this approach, both associated with page loading times. First, page loading times vary. To scrape a dynamic page in this fashion, first Selenium starts loading the page. Then the program waits for some set time. After waiting, Selenium passes the loaded page's HTML to BeautifulSoup for parsing. But if the page isn't loaded, the program could crash or at best there will be missing data. To prevent this, the program has to wait for several seconds for pages to load, which becomes prohibitively slow to scrape the whole site. Second, the pages just generally load slowly. This method would have taken several days even with a reasonably low loss rate of around 1% of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second approach requires determining if the website gets its data from an API. If it does, you may use the API to load the data in JSON format. The advantages here are that you do not have to spend time loading the actual pages, there is data in the API that is not loaded on the page, and the API stores data in a more human readable format than on in the HTML. To find the API, load the page in a browser (I use Firefox for this). Open the developer tools panel with the F12 key. Click the Network tab on the panel and the XHR button on the row below that. Reload the page. The list should populate, and if you look for requests with Type JSON, you should eventually find the API urls. You can use a tool like Insomnia to quickly generate code to make requests to the API with Python. The problem in this case is the APIs did not accept requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third and final approach combines the previous. I use the API, but I use Selenium to load the response to API requests in the browser rather than the pages that display data from the API. These are in JSON format and load nearly instantly. This eliminates or reduces the downsides of the first approach (slow, lost data) and retains most of the benefits of the second approach (faster, no lost data, more features). For scale, this probably speeds up the scraping process by about an order of magnitude, with no lost data."

    "# Leaderboard\n",
    "The first step is to get data from the leaderboard page itself. Since so much data can be retrived from the API that loads the profile pages, all that is needed from the leaderboard are the names of players and platforms they play on. The players usernames and platforms are combined to make a features I call \"player_id.\" These take the form (platform_abbreviation)/(username). In addition to serving as identifiers for players, they are needed to get unique information about players from the API."

All of these are stored in easy to navigate JSON strings, but they each require different API requests. In both categories, stats are given in raw format (ex. 10000 in the score feature means the player's total score while playing has been 10000) and percentile format (ex. 1.9 in the score feature means the player is in the 1.9% of highest scorign players).

    "A potential programatic approach could go as follows: each leaderboard url ends in a page number. Call this i. You could increase i in increasingly larger step sizes until you no longer load pages with HTML in the form expected. Then I could be decreased in increasingly larger step size until it loaded a page with increasingly larger step sizes until it found a page of the form desired. This could be repeated until it converged on the last page. This is only one fairly naive approach. Generally, it's a search through a sequence of integers that is unbounded on one side."
